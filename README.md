# Browser extension to open GitHub file links in your IDE

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/lmichelin/open-github-links-in-ide.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/lmichelin/open-github-links-in-ide)

This browser extension allows you to open files in your IDE directly from GitHub, assuming the repository you are working on is cloned on your computer. When a fragment of a file is displayed, your IDE opens the file and puts the cursor at the desired line.

## Getting started

Once the extension is installed:

- Click on the extension icon to open the settings popup
- Set the local path where GitHub repositories are cloned on your computer
- Select the IDE you want to use to open GitHub links
- Reload GitHub and start using the extension

## Supported IDEs:

- VS Code
- VSCodium
- VS Code Insiders
- PhpStorm
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Any JetBrains editor (using built-in web server)
- WebStorm (not tested yet)
- GoLand
- CLion

WSL with the Ubuntu distribution is also supported on VS Code, VSCodium and VS Code Insiders for Windows.

PhpStorm & IntelliJ IDEA support is native on MacOS, but on Linux and Windows you need to install an url handler (see [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56066943/104891)):

- Linux: https://github.com/sanduhrs/phpstorm-url-handler
- Windows: https://github.com/aik099/PhpStormProtocol

I have not tested WebStorm support yet, feedbacks are welcome!

You can also use the built-in web server of any JetBrains editor (IDEA, WebStorm, PhpStorm, WebStorm, ...) instead of the url handler. For that you need to install the PHP plugin. See [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/php-built-in-web-server.html) for more information. The built-in web server must be started on port 63342.

> To disable JetBrains warning "_'file' API is requested. Do you trust unknown host?_", you can go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Debugger` and Check the _Allow unsigned requests_ in the _Built-in Server_ section.
